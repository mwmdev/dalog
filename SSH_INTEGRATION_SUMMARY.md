# SSH Integration Summary

## Overview

I've successfully integrated SSH support into dalog, allowing users to view and monitor remote log files via SSH connections. This feature enables developers to monitor production logs without directly logging into servers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies
- Added `paramiko>=3.0.0` to `pyproject.toml` for SSH connectivity

### 2. Core Modules

#### `src/dalog/core/remote_reader.py`
- Created `LogReader` abstract base class for unified log reading interface
- Implemented `SSHLogReader` class for remote file reading via SSH
- Added `RemoteFileWatcher` for checking remote file changes
- Supports SSH URL formats: `user@host:/path` and `ssh://user@host:port/path`

#### `src/dalog/core/log_reader.py`
- Created `LocalLogReader` wrapper for existing `LogProcessor`
- Implemented `create_unified_log_reader()` factory function
- Provides consistent interface for both local and SSH files

#### `src/dalog/core/ssh_file_watcher.py`
- Implemented `SSHFileWatcherThread` for background monitoring
- Created `AsyncSSHFileWatcher` for Textual integration
- Supports periodic polling of remote files with configurable intervals

### 3. Application Updates

#### `src/dalog/cli.py`
- Added `validate_log_source()` to handle both local paths and SSH URLs
- Updated help text with SSH examples
- No longer requires SSH URLs to be existing local files

#### `src/dalog/app.py`
- Updated to use unified log reader interface
- Integrated SSH file watcher for live reload support
- Added separate handlers for local and SSH file changes

#### `src/dalog/widgets/log_viewer.py`
- Added `load_from_reader()` method to support unified reader interface
- Works seamlessly with both local and SSH sources

### 4. Tests
- Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_core/test_ssh_reader.py`
- Tests URL parsing, SSH connections, file reading, and change detection

### 5. Documentation
- Updated README.md with SSH examples and dedicated SSH section
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md with SSH architecture details
- Added SSH URL format documentation

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic SSH usage
dalog user@server:/var/log/app.log

# With custom port
dalog admin@server:2222:/logs/error.log

# With search and filtering
dalog --search ERROR --exclude DEBUG user@host:/var/log/app.log

# With tail for large files
dalog --tail 1000 user@host:/var/log/large.log

# Live reload works automatically
dalog user@host:/var/log/active.log
```

## Key Features

1. **Authentication**: Uses system SSH configuration (keys, agent, config)
2. **Efficiency**: Uses `tail` command for large files, streaming for full reads
3. **Live Reload**: Periodic polling with automatic updates
4. **Full Integration**: All existing features (search, filtering, visual mode) work with SSH

## Technical Details

- SSH connections use paramiko with auto-add host key policy
- Remote file reading optimized with tail for performance
- File watching polls every 2 seconds by default (configurable)
- Graceful error handling for connection issues
- Context managers ensure proper resource cleanup

## Next Steps

The SSH integration is fully functional. Potential future enhancements could include:
- Configuration options for polling intervals
- SSH connection pooling for multiple files from same host
- Support for SSH jump hosts/proxies
- Integration with SSH config aliases
